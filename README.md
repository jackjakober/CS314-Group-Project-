# README
This is the codebase for a team project that I worked on during my third year of my computer science degree. 

Worked with team of 6, using proper GitHub etiquette and Agile Scrum development practices. The project was a trip planning/travel application designed to help users plan and modify a trip. 

I was an active contributor for my team and I learned a lot about real world software development. 
Some code that I wrote entirerly by myself for my team is in

server/src/main/java/com/tco/misc/OptimizeTour.java 

Here I wrote an algorithm to optimize a users trip by reordering places based on what places are near. (nearest neighbor algorithm). The solution I wrote was implemented correctly according our tests and our professors test that were used to grade us. 

This is just an example of a codebase that I have worked on and some code that I wrote.
